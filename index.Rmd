  <!-- Hello! I'm Peter. I'm a social scientist with expertise in American politics and social policy.  -->

  <!-- This site remains under development.... -->

  <!-- In the meantime, you can check out my existing website [here](http://www.peterbucchianeri.com) or view my CV [here](files/Bucchianeri_CV_Web.pdf). -->

  Hello! I'm Peter. I'm a social scientist with expertise in American politics and social policy. I am currently a research consultant for the [Center for Effective Lawmaking](https://thelawmakers.org/), where I am developing effectiveness scores for over 20,000 current and former state legislators. 
  
  My academic research, which has been published in the *American Political Science Review* and *Political Behavior*, examines how social and political institutions shape the preferences and behaviors of elected officials in the United States, particularly at the subnational level. In practice, this means I ask and answer questions such as: how do political parties impact the electoral and legislative processes? What role does competition play in fostering a healthy democracy? And why are some legislators more effective at influencing public policy than others? For additional information about my work in these areas, please see my [research](research.html) page.
